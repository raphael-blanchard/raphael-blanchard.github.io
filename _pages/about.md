About Me
--------
I am a 2nd year master student at **Centrale Nantes (ECN)** studying Advanced Robotics.


Aside from that, I am a research intern at the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/) at the **Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**, under the supervision of [Professor Sebastian Scherer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxoPfIYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shibo Zhao](https://shibowing.github.io/). We are currently working on **autonomous navigation** in perceptually degraded environments.

I want to enable any kind of robot (aerial, legged, wheeled) to autonomously navigate in **challenging environments**.
