About Me
--------
I am a 2nd year master student at **Centrale Nantes (ECN)** studying Advanced Robotics.

Currently, I am a Visiting Student Researcher at the [ARCLab](https://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/) at **Caltech**, under the supervision of **Professor Soon-Jo Chung**. My research focuses on **Scenario-Aware Localization and Mapping in Extreme Environments**, with applications to **planetary robotic exploration**. I am also part of Caltech's team for the **Indy Autonomous Challenge**, where I focus on **high-speed localization** for autonomous race cars.


Aside from that, I am working with the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/) at the **Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**, under the supervision of [Professor Sebastian Scherer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxoPfIYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shibo Zhao](https://shibowing.github.io/). I work on improving localization in extreme scenarios by leveraging information from IMU sensors.
