About Me
--------
I am a master student at Centrale Nantes (ECN) studying Advanced Robotics.

<!-- Aside from that, I am a research intern at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I work at the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/) on **autonomous navigation** in challenging environments, under the supervision of [Professor Sebastian Scherer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxoPfIYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shibo Zhao](https://shibowing.github.io/). -->
